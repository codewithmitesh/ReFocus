## Overview

Refocusing aids in maintaining students' engaged engagement in the lesson, hence raising attention span. The enhanced Teacher Login gives instructors a variety of choices, allowing for greater student data analysis. It also permits exporting data for other uses. Students may keep track of their progress, scheduled activities, and study reports with the aid of the user-friendly dashboard. Using the Pomodoro approach, the student's goals for cognitive development and awareness during the brief intermission between tasks were met.
